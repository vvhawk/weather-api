# Weather API üå¶Ô∏è
**NOTE:**  
*This project is based on a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0VEOghdMpQ) I used it to learn about APIs*
 
## Overview
This web app uses the [Open-Meto's](https://open-meteo.com/) [Weather Forecast API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) to show the current, daily, and hourly weather for the week. It updates based on the user's location.

## Implementation
[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) were all utilized to craft this experience.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) was used as the development environment
